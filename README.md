An advance wikipedia made up for collecting curated information from all over the top Websites.
This is my Intern project in Wibe Labs, in which they are trying to overcome the quality problem of information.
Frontend Technologies used are:
HTML,
CSS,
JQUERY,
Polymer Google Framework,
Javascript,
JSON,
and the whole website is modular.
